webpackJsonp([0],{"./instructions/user/user-summary.en.md":function(e,o){e.exports="**Name** - The name of the user appears throughout the Trambar application. It is used to order users alphabetically in the *People* page.\n\n**User name** - The user name should be compose of simply Latin latters and numbers. It can be used to \"mention\" a user in a post or comment (e.g. *I think you should look at this @john*).\n\n**E-mail** - A user's e-mail address is used to connect his Trambar account to his account at an OAuth provider (GitLab, Facebook, Google Plus, etc.). It must match exactly.\n\n**Phone number** - A user's phone number is shown when another user chooses the contact-by-phone option in the *People* page.\n\n**Profile image** - A user's profile image appears throughout the Trambar application. If an image is not provided here, the user's profile image at the OAuth provider will be used.\n\nSetting an image here means the user's profile image will not change when he changes it at the OAuth provider.\n\n**User type** - There are four types of user in Trambar:\n\n_Guest users_ cannot see stories that are flagged as non-public. They also cannot see contact information. People who are not part of your organization should be given this type of user accounts.\n\n_Regular users_ are people who are part of your organization or those whom you can trust with non-public information.\n\n_Moderators_ have the same privileges as regular users plus they can delete posts and comments of other users or make them non-public.\n\n_Administrators_ can manage the web site using the Administrative Console as well as moderate posts and comments.\n\n**Roles** - User roles enable filtering of stories and statistics by roles. Their assignment may also impact how often stories written by people of a given role appear in the News Feed.\n"}});
