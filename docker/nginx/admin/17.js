The simplest\nconfiguration is make administrators administrators, regular users regular\nusers, and external users guests on Trambar. Or you may choose to make all\nregular users at GitLab moderators, so they can remove undesirable posts\ncreated by others.\n\n**Role assignment** - You can automatically assign roles to new users\nauthenticated through this server. For instance, you may choose to assign a\n\"Developer\" role to all users coming from GitLab.\n\n**Site URL** - The URL of the Trambar website. It's set in the Settings page.\nIt's used to form the callback URL.\n\n**Callback URI** - You will need this URL when you create an app in GitLab.\nFirst, log into GitLab as an administrator. Go to the *Applications* page in\nthe admin area (the wrench icon). Press the *New Application* button. Enter\na name for the application (e.g. _Rick's Trambar_). Then copy this URL into\nthe box under *Redirect URI*. For *Scopes*, check *API* and *read_user*. You\nmay optionally choose to treat Trambar as a trusted app. For testing purpose,\nyou may want to leave this off initially. Press *Submit* to save your changes.\n\n**GitLab URL** - The base URL of the GitLab server (e.g. https://gitlab.trambar.io).\n\nEven if GitLab is running on the same computer as Trambar, this URL can never\nhave localhost as the host name. From Trambar's perspective, localhost refers to\nthe Docker container in which it runs. You must use the computer's IP address\ninstead (which cannot be 127.0.0.1).\n\nIf the GitLab server is using SSL, be sure the URL's protocol is HTTPS. Trambar\ndoes not follow HTTP to HTTPS redirections.\n\n**Application ID** - Copy the application ID from GitLab.\n\n**Application secret** - Copy the application secret from GitLab. On occasions,\nwhen you reuse an app's credentials, GitLab will not honor them. If that\nhappens, try destroying the app and recreating it.\n\n**API access** - Trambar needs administrative access to GitLab in order to\nscan repository activity logs and create issues in GitLab's issue tracker. Once\nyou have saved the data entered into this page, click the *Acquire API access*\nbutton (which should be automatically selected). If you're still logged in as\nan administrator in GitLab, you will be presented with the option to authorize\nTrambar. Press the *Authorize* button. A simple \"OK\" will appear when the\nprocess is successful.\n\nAfterward, this item should read *Administrative access acquired*. You will now\nbe able to attach a GitLab repository to a new Trambar project.\n"}});
