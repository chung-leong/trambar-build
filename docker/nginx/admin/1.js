It appears in the terms and conditions.\n\n**Description** - The site description appears in the *Start* page. If it is\nlong, a scroll bar will appear.\n\n**Address** - The address of the web site is used during OAuth authentication.\nIt is also used by GitLab event hooks and when mobile notifications are sent.\nIt may include a port number. For testing purpose, an internal IP address will\nwork, provided it is reachable by the GitLab server. HTTPS is needed for\nproduction deployment: Notification does not work when a site is unsecured.\n\n**Push relay** - A push relay is used to send push notifications to mobile\ndevices. There are currently two relays: one located in Virginia, United States\n(_us-east-1.push.trambar.io_) and one located in Dublin, Ireland\n(_eu-west-1.push.trambar.io_).\n\n**Background image** - The background image spans the width of the browser in\nthe *Start* page. It should be relatively high-resolution. It will be scaled\ndown and compressed to a suitable file size.\n\n**Input languages** - When you select more than one input languages, you will\nbe given the option to enter text such as the site description in different\nlanguages.\n\nCurrently, only the Administrative Console supports multilingual input.\n"}});
